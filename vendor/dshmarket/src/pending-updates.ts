/**
 * The journal for the desktop manager's only update shape: remove, then add.
 *
 * dsh 0.2.1's plugin manager has no in-place update (#896): `add` on a package
 * the profile already declares is refused before pnpm runs. Every update on
 * that host is therefore two operations — `removeBundle` and `installBundle` —
 * and the first one writes the profile. When the host's own reload never
 * returns (its reconciliation awaits plugin lifecycles with no deadline), the
 * removal is already on disk and the replacement never runs: after the next
 * restart the plugin is simply gone (#928).
 *
 * This journal is written BEFORE the removal and cleared only once the install
 * settles. The next start reads it and puts back whatever is missing, so an
 * interrupted update ends as "installed, one restart later" instead of as a
 * plugin the user has to notice is gone.
 *
 * The file lives beside the market's other per-profile state
 * (`<profile>/.dsh-market/`), not in the market's memory and not in DSH home:
 * a profile copied or reset elsewhere must not inherit another profile's
 * unfinished update, and a test that builds a throwaway profile must not touch
 * the real one.
