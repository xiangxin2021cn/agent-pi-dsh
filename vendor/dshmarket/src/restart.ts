/**
 * The process supervisor running this host, when one can be identified —
 * `null` when nothing says so.
 *
 * This exists because the failure it prevents is the worst one the market
 * can cause. Under systemd's default `KillMode=control-group`, everything in
 * the unit's cgroup dies with the main process — including the detached
 * helper that was supposed to bring the replacement up. So "restart" killed
 * a production service and nothing came back (#229 by @SkillBase-Al: "杀死了
 * 服务但是无法重复启动服务"). `allowRestart: false` was always the documented
 * answer, but it is opt-in, and nothing told the operator to opt in until
 * after they had already lost the service.
 *
 * TWO signals are required, and the second is the whole reason this function
 * is not a one-line env check. `INVOCATION_ID` is INHERITED: every
 * descendant of a systemd unit carries it, which on Linux includes an
 * ordinary desktop terminal (its shell descends from a user-session unit)
 * and a CI runner (the agent is a unit — this repo's own smoke test caught
 * that). Treating inheritance as ownership would disable the button for a
 * large population of hosts where it works fine, which is a worse bug than
 * the one being fixed.
 *
 * The parent test is what distinguishes being the unit's own main process
 * from merely descending from one: a terminal's node has the shell as its
 * parent and a runner's has the agent. It used to be `ppid === 1`, which is
 * only true for SYSTEM units. A per-user unit's service is forked by that
 * user's manager instance — `systemd --user`, an ordinary PID — so user-unit
 * hosts read as unsupervised, and one-click restart killed them for good
 * (#471 by @automagik-genie, with the journal to prove the whole chain:
 * clean SIGTERM exit → `Restart=on-failure` does not fire → `KillMode=mixed`
 * SIGKILLs the detached helper before it can spawn the replacement). So the
 * parent counts as a manager when it is PID 1 or its comm is `systemd` —
 * the one name both manager instances share and the false-positive parents
 * (shells, CI agents) never carry. `/proc` is Linux-only, which is exactly
 * as wide as systemd itself; anywhere it cannot be read the answer stays
 * "not a manager".
 *
 * Scoped to systemd on purpose. pm2 sets `pm_id`, but it is inherited the
 * same way and pm2's God daemon — not PID 1 — is the parent, so there is no
 * equivalent second signal; a guess there would reintroduce exactly the
 * false positive this pair exists to avoid. launchd has no marker at all.
 * Both still need the explicit setting: detection is a safety net over the
 * documented option, never a replacement for it.
