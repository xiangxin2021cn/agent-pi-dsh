/**
 * The host's own "open this bundle's page" entry (dsh 0.2.1+).
 *
 * The Plugins page documents `pluginNavigation.openBundle(packageName)` for
 * other client plugins: it selects that page and shows the bundle, without
 * touching the running Session. The market uses it from an installed plugin's
 * ··· menu, because the host's page is the only place a bundle's ROWS can be
 * switched on and off one by one — the market draws the bundle's own switch
 * and nothing below it.
 *
 * A store rather than a plain value: the service arrives with the host's
 * plugin manager, which may load after this package, and a menu drawn from a
 * snapshot taken at setup would never offer the action on a host that has it.
