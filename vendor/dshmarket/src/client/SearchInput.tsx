 * @bulingbuling688, whose clear button reached the same four fields from
 * outside this component). Two things made the difference:
 *
 * - it has to clear the DRAFT, not the committed query. Between a keystroke
 *   and the 250ms commit, the text on screen and the parent's `value` are
 *   different strings; a button that only reset `value` would leave the old
 *   text visible until the effect below rewrote the draft, and would schedule
 *   its own debounce on the way out.
 * - the padding that keeps a long query off the button belongs to whoever
 *   renders the button. As a prop of the call sites it is a rule four rows
 *   have to remember and a fifth would forget.
