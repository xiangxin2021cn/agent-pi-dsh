/**
 * Host ui-primitives the market uses WHEN THE RUNNING HOST HAS THEM.
 *
 * The primitives module is injected by the host, so the set of components
 * available at render time is whatever that host ships — 0.1.0-rc.7 has 25
 * export groups, 0.1.7-rc.2 has 51. A component the host has should be used
 * rather than re-implemented: the market sits inside the host's settings page,
 * and a hand-rolled lookalike drifts from it the moment either side changes.
 *
 * Anything resolved here MUST have a fallback at its call site, and the
 * fallback is the market's own markup — that is the whole difference between
 * this and `REQUIRED_PRIMITIVES` (src/client/index.ts), which decides whether
 * the market can render at all. Same rule as the icon aliases
 * (src/client/icons.ts): a host that predates a component costs that one
 * component's upgrade, never the page.
 *
 * `null` means "this host does not have it", which is the ordinary case on the
 * 0.1.x hosts the market still supports — so a call site that forgets its
 * fallback fails loudly in tests (which run against an old host's 0.1.0-rc.7)
 * rather than silently in production.
