/**
 * pnpm store hygiene: reclaim staging directories orphaned by aborted runs,
 * and the profile-side quarantine pnpm never empties (`node_modules/.ignored`).
 *
 * pnpm extracts every fetched tarball under the store's `tmp/` directory as
 * `tmp/_tmp_<pid>_<hex>/`. A run that is killed, cancelled, or timed out —
 * or one that hard-fails mid-fetch — never finishes that staging step, so
 * the directory survives. For `github:` sources the staged payload is the
 * WHOLE repository tarball, so a single aborted install can leave hundreds
 * of megabytes behind (e.g. an OpenViking monorepo install killed at ~88MB).
 *
 * The directory name carries the owning pnpm process id, which makes
 * reclamation safe by construction: when that pid is gone, no live download
 * can be using the directory. Live pnpm tmp dirs are never touched.
 *
 * Separately, under `nodeLinker: hoisted` pnpm moves alien / interrupted
 * package directories into `node_modules/.ignored` and never reclaims them
 * (#974; pnpm #13720). Those copies are already out of the tree — Node does
 * not resolve through `.ignored` — so they are safe to delete once our pnpm
 * process has exited. The pid in a `_tmp_<pid>_` name is historical there
 * and is not consulted (Windows reuses pids; a live match would skip a
 * dead quarantine). `.bak` leftovers stay: they are someone else's wreckage,
 * not pnpm staging (#205, #974).
