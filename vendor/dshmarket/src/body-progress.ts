 * multi-megabyte tarball: at 3.2 MB it needs 158 KB/s sustained, and a China
 * mirror jittering to 17–40 KB/s cannot make that, so both attempts died at
 * the ceiling while the link was still delivering bytes.

 * at 4s it hid slowness behind a stale snapshot, at 15s it kills downloads
 * that are still moving. On a lossy proxied link the catalog body trickles
 * for far longer than 15s while never once going silent — measured 89.9s
 * end-to-end for a body the 15s cutoff had declared dead twice. This reader
 * lets a moving body run as long as it keeps moving, in either direction's
 * sense of "slow", and ends one that goes quiet for `stallMs` with a message
 * that says what actually happened and how much had arrived.
 *
 * The rejection comes from here, not from an abort: undici's abort message
 * ("This operation was aborted") cannot tell a user anything actionable, and
 * a bug report containing this string will contain the byte count too.
 *
 * Two backstops keep "still moving" from meaning "forever", because the
 * watchdog can only see pauses: a total ceiling for a body that trickles
 * without ever pausing, and a size cap for one that outruns any catalog.
