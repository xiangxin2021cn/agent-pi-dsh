  // #389 by @qq1054435284: on Windows, pnpm stages the new version in a
  // sibling `<name>_tmp_<pid>_<n>` directory and renames it over the old one.
  // Windows refuses that rename while any file underneath the target is open,
  // and the process holding them is usually the one asking. POSIX does not
  // have this problem: replacing an open file there leaves the old inode
  // alive for whoever still holds it.
  //
  // Worded for the RENAME, not for an update (#441 by @yandidan1). The
  // reporter met this while INSTALLING — a reinstall of a plugin they had
  // just uninstalled — and was told their update had not applied, that their
  // existing version was intact, and to disable the plugin under Installed,
  // which they had already removed. The package pnpm names here is also not
  // necessarily a plugin: theirs was `node-hid`, a dependency.
  //
  // The native-module sentence is the part that makes the advice usable in
  // that case. Node never unloads a native addon: once a `.node` is loaded
  // there is no dlclose, so disabling the plugin, unmounting it, or
  // uninstalling it cannot release the file — only ending the process does.
  // That is why "uninstall, then install again" fails on Windows for those
  // plugins while it works for every other one.
  //
  // Not retried automatically. A retry from inside the same process cannot
  // win, because that process is the thing holding the handles; retrying
  // would only turn one clear failure into several slow ones. So this names
  // the cause and the ways out instead of guessing.
