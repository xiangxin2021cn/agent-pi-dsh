/**
 * The market's own settings namespace: the half that makes `allowRestart`
 * a switch on the plugin configuration page instead of a line the user has
 * to hand-write into cordis.yml.
 *
 * `allowRestart: false` is the documented answer for a host owned by
 * systemd, launchd or pm2 — a supervisor restarts it, so the market's
 * one-click restart must not launch a second one. Until now the only way to
 * say that was editing YAML in the right place with the right indentation,
 * where a stray space stops the profile booting.
 *
 * Only `allowRestart` is exposed. `profile` names which profile this
 * instance manages: it is decided at mount from the composition or the
 * command line, and a running instance cannot switch to another one, so
 * offering it as a field would promise something the write cannot deliver.
 * Desktop registers an empty schema instead: the namespace still admits its
 * card, but the shell owns restart and no settings value feeds its routes.
 *
 * The release channel is NOT here either, and that is a correction rather
 * than an omission. It was, briefly, and it made this namespace a second
 * writer for a value the market already stores in its own state.json: the
 * mount read the user's saved channel off disk, then `onChange` assigned
 * `source().channel` — which knows nothing about that file — straight back
 * over it. The choice survived exactly until the next settings event.
 *
 * Only a real host could show that; the unit lane mounts the routes without
 * this layer at all. `allowRestart` needs this door because its only other
 * one is hand-edited YAML. The channel has a control of its own on the
 * plugin configuration page, so a second door bought nothing and cost the
 * setting its memory.
 *
 * The wiring rides the scoped fiber, so a host with no settings service —
 * every dsh before 0.1.0-rc.7 — simply never runs any of this and the entry
 * configuration stands as composed. That is why this needs no version check
 * of its own.
 *
 * It depends on the SERVICE and nothing else, which is the whole point of
 * the shape below. This module used to import two convenience helpers,
 * `installSettingsSection` and `settingsNamespace`, from
 * `@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings`. dsh 0.1.2-alpha.1 deleted both — and a
 * missing NAMED EXPORT is not a missing service. `ctx.inject` degrades
 * quietly; an ESM named import that resolves to nothing is a SyntaxError at
 * module evaluation, which cordis's loader reports as a failed entry and the
 * host exits 1. Installing the market stopped the host from booting at all:
 *
 *   SyntaxError: The requested module '@deepseek-ai/dsh-settings' does not
 *   provide an export named 'installSettingsSection'
 *
 * The service itself did not change then — `sctx.settings.register(ns,
 * schema, { base })` is identical in 0.1.0-rc.7 and 0.1.2-alpha.2. Only the
 * two wrappers went away. So this inlines what the wrapper did (verified
 * against its source: an inject, a register, a watch, and an unload effect)
 * and validates the namespace here.
 *
 * It DID change in 0.1.7 (#677): `SettingsService` there has `describe` and
 * `update` and no `register` — namespaces are derived from a plugin's Config
 * schema instead. The `settings` service still exists, so the inject callback
 * runs and `register` threw a TypeError that cordis swallowed. Both entry
 * points now check for the method and, without it, leave the composed entry
 * standing and say so once in the host log. That is a stop-gap, not the
 * migration: on 0.1.7 the allowRestart switch is absent until the market
 * moves to the new model.
