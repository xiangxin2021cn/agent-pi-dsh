/**
 * What DSH's own fatal recovery leaves behind (#875).
 *
 * When a boot fails, the desktop shell offers a recovery prompt. Using it
 * runs `sanitizeProfile` in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-app-boot`, and that does not
 * edit the profile patch — it renames `cordis.patch.yml` to a
 * `<patch>.bak-<epoch ms>` sibling, writes a small default stub in its place,
 * and restores the bundle list it was handed. The app then comes up normally,
 * so from the outside there is no error at all: the stub looks exactly like a
 * patch that never had content, and the backup is an unlabelled file sitting
 * next to it with no timestamp a person would read. In the report that found
 * this, 22 KB of providers, models, model defaults and permission presets
 * vanished that way and nothing on screen said so.
 *
 * DSH core is the one destroying data, and the fix for that belongs upstream
 * (never overwrite a patch that has content; keep an unticked entry as a
 * disabled row instead of dropping it from `dsh.profile.bundles`). But the
 * promise the user was acting on is this page's — the market's own recovery
 * surface is the documented way back to a booting app — so the market carries
 * the detection and the way back.
 *
 * The shape this looks for is deliberately narrow: a sibling named exactly
 * `<patch name>.bak-<digits>`, holding rows, LARGER than the live patch, and
 * naming rows the live patch no longer has. A hand-edited file, the market's
 * own `.bak` shapes (`package.json.bak-asm` and friends), an older backup, or
 * a patch that simply lost a row are all outside this surface — the point is
 * to speak up only when the evidence is unambiguous, because a false alarm
 * here trains the user to ignore the one that matters.
