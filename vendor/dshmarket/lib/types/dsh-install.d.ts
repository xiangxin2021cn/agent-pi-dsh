/** Locate the DSH host package in CLI and packaged Desktop runtimes. */
/**
 * The version of the DSH host this market is running inside.
 *
 * CLI versions come from the host manifest. Flat Desktop shells additionally
 * require agreement with their bundled split runtime, never profile packages.
 *
 * Worth reporting because the host version has repeatedly been the thing
 * neither side could see. #293 turned on it (the reporter was on
 * 0.1.1-rc.2 while every attempt to reproduce had been on 0.1.0-rc.8, which
 * nobody knew until three rounds in), and #404 is entirely about a plugin
 * that requires a host newer than the Desktop build it was installed on.
 *
 * The directory comes back too, because WHERE it was found is the other half
 * of the answer: a path under Electron's resources is a Desktop-bundled host,
 * which #139 established can be older than whatever `npm ls` would report.
 * Asking the user is not a substitute — that is the number they do not have.
 * @returns the host version and the directory it was read from, or null when
 * no host package is locatable (a plain `dsh web` from a global install can
 * legitimately land here).

/**
 * Walk up from the CLI entry first, then inspect Electron's authoritative
 * resources directory. Desktop distributions may keep node_modules outside
 * the ASAR, expose them through ASAR's virtual filesystem, or disable ASAR.
 *
 * The entry is resolved through symlinks before the walk, because for a
 * globally installed dsh it IS one. `npm i -g` and Homebrew both put a link
 * in a `bin/` directory pointing at the real package, so `process.argv[1]`
 * is `/opt/homebrew/bin/dsh` and walking up from there reaches `/` without
 * ever passing the package. Measured: the same call answers `null` for the
 * link and the correct directory for its target.
 *
 * That was not a cosmetic gap. Everything downstream reads the host version
 * from here — the exported log's `dsh host:` line (#426), Discover's
 * host-requirement column and filter (#473), and the pre-update check
 * (#404) — and a null version makes every one of them answer "unknown",
 * silently, on exactly the ordinary global install. A bundled Desktop host
 * is reached by the resources branch below and was never affected, which is
 * why this survived: the case that worked is the one that gets tested.
