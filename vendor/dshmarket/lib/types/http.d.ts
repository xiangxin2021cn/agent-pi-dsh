 * `Origin` on every POST — including same-origin and cross-origin form
 * submissions. A request that arrives WITHOUT it therefore did not come from
 * a page at all, and a non-browser client can set any Origin it likes, so
 * refusing the header's absence bought nothing while breaking a whole

 * `cookie` and `sec-fetch-site` before forwarding to the in-process host and
 * injects a cookie only that host can sign. Every mutating request from the
 * Desktop build was answered 403 `untrusted origin`.
 *
 * What still holds after the change, and is the part worth keeping:
 *
 * - a cross-site page is refused — its Origin is present and different;
 * - `Origin: null` (a sandboxed iframe, a `data:` document) is refused, because
 *   `null` is a present-but-unparseable origin, not an absent one;
 * - a same-host-but-different-port request is refused;
 * - an EMPTY Origin is refused too: the header being present and unparseable
 *   is not the same statement as its being absent, and only absence is what
 *   a stripping proxy produces.
 *
 * The header's absence is a statement about the client, not about intent, and
