/**
 * Which loader entry belongs to which installed package (#646).
 *
 * The ecosystem does not require a bundle patch's row `name:` to be the
 * package name. Two shapes are ordinary:
 *
 *     - id: aegis-method-pack
 *       name: aegis/extensions/dsh/index.js     ← a SUBPATH inside the package
 *     - id: filesystem
 *       name: @deepseek-ai/dsh-skill-filesystem  ← another package entirely
 *
 * `dsh-chat-import`, `meow-memory` and `dsh-context` all name themselves, so
 * the simple `name === packageName` comparison worked for years. `aegis`
 * names an entry inside itself, and every site that compared the two
 * directly concluded the plugin had no entry — the market reported "no
 * bundle patch … nothing to hot-mount" on enable (#646) and could not see
 * the entry was already live.
 *
 * Three such sites had grown independently (`src/themes.ts`, `src/verify.ts`,
 * `src/routes.ts`), each restating the rule from memory. That is the shape
 * the identity bugs #485→#605 came from: one assumption, several copies,
 * each fixed at a different time. The rule lives here now, once.
 *
 * The carrier case (#156) is NOT decided here. A bundle that mounts someone
 * else's package has no name relation at all, and is recognised by the entry
 * ID its own patch inserts — see `bundlePatchInsertedIds`. The two rules
 * compose; neither replaces the other.
