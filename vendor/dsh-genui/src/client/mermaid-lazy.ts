 * main client bundle stays small and most conversations never download
 * mermaid at all. On a host that does not serve the asset (older harness) the
 * load rejects and the MermaidNode shows its plain-source fallback.
 *
 * The pure source utilities stay statically exported from mermaid-safe so
 * tests (and any consumer) can use them without the engine.
