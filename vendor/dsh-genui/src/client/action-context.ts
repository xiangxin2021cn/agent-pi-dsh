/**
 * GenUI action context, plugin-owned.
 *
 * Contract hosts (`dsh-host-0812-contract` and later) ship the same context
 * in `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives` and MarkdownText installs the
 * provider around fence renders — the renderer MUST consume that exact
 * context instance so the host's action wiring reaches our components.
 * Pristine hosts (the stock snapshot line) export no such symbol; the DOM
 * render channel then falls back to the local context and installs its own
 * provider (this package wraps every tree it mounts).
 *
 * Absent provider = v1 behavior: interactive components are display-only
 * (their `action` is ignored). The hook never throws.
