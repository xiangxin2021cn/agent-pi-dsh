/**
 * DOM render channel: pure-plugin fence rendering for pristine hosts.
 *
 * Stock DSH renders every fenced code block through the shared CodeBlock
 * surface (stable class `md-code-block`, language label rendered as the
 * banner's childless label div). This channel observes the conversation DOM,
 * finds blocks labelled `dsh-ui`, parses the raw fence body and mounts the
 * plugin's own React tree next to the (hidden) stock block:
 *
 * Fence discovery is **multi-surface** (issue #6): besides `md-code-block`,
 * the channel also matches the deepsuite-style surfaces some host builds
 * render instead (`.code-block` / `.code-block-small`), and — as the
 * structural backstop — ANY element whose banner labels it `dsh-ui` and
 * which contains a `<pre>` body. The only invariants are the language label
 * (a leaf element with the exact text `dsh-ui`, outside the code body) and
 * the `<pre>`, so a host DOM drift degrades to a rendered fence, never a
 * silently skipped one:
 *
 * - **Streaming takeover**: the channel takes over a dsh-ui block as soon as
 *   ONE finished component parses (the partial parser), and re-renders the
 *   root as the body grows — the UI assembles top-down while the reply
 *   streams, no settled marker required. A body with no finished component
 *   yet stays a stock code block (partial JSON must never look broken).
 * - **Pre-paint surgery repair**: the host's React re-renders during
 *   streaming can wipe our foreign container or reset the hide. A repair
 *   pass in the MutationObserver microtask re-applies the surgery before
 *   paint (same pattern the annotation plugin proved on this host), and the
 *   1s sweep is the backstop.
 * - **Settled transition**: when `[data-streaming]` leaves the row, the
 *   mount re-renders with the stable source identity — the moment panels
 *   publish and durable state keys in (mirrors the registry channel's
 *   settled-source semantics; streaming renders are identity-less).
 * - Stable identity: the owning row's `data-chat-anchor-key` (session-stable,
 *   seq-derived) + the fence's ordinal among settled dsh-ui blocks in that
 *   row. `sourceId = dom:<anchor>:<ordinal>` feeds panel dedup and durable
 *   state.
 * - Actions ride the plugin-owned GenuiActionContext provider: every tree
 *   this channel mounts is wrapped with a handler that relays
 *   `[genui-action]` through the scoped conversation send — no host plumbing.
 * - Removal (branch switch, unload): each mount is unmounted with its root,
 *   and the stock block is restored.
 *
 * Security posture matches the registry channel: only code shipped in this
 * plugin's browser bundle mounts React roots, the model can only author
 * fence text, and unrepairable bodies stay stock code blocks.
