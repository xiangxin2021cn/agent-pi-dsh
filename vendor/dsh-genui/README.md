The model no longer just answers in text. Install this plugin, ask "how are this month's orders doing", and it renders a **clickable data panel** right inside the answer as it analyzes: watch trends, drag sliders, hit refresh — and the model actually responds.

## ⚠️ Read this first: dual-channel rendering (works with any dsh build)

The plugin ships **two rendering channels** and picks one automatically at startup — no dependency on a specific host version:

- **Registry channel**: when the host exposes the `fence-registry` extension point (newer dsh builds), fences register through the host's streaming render pipeline and behave seamlessly with the host;
- **DOM channel**: when the host lacks that extension point (including stock DSH and older builds), the plugin observes the session DOM and mounts its own render tree. Since 0.7.2 it **supports streaming rendering**: components appear as the model writes them — the first finished component shows up immediately, no need to wait for the whole reply. Since 0.8.3 fence discovery is **multi-surface**: it matches the stock `md-code-block` surface, the deepsuite-style `.code-block` / `.code-block-small` surfaces some host builds render instead, and — as a structural backstop — any element whose banner labels it `dsh-ui` and contains a `<pre>` body. If your dsh build renders fences with a different class name, they still render (and a one-time console warning tells you the host DOM drifted).

Whichever channel is active, components, interactions, panels, and persistence behave identically.

## ✨ Before vs. after

| Plain answer | With dsh-genui |
|---|---|
| "Revenue this month: ¥128,430, +12.4% MoM — watch the conversion rate." | One line of analysis + three stat cards (revenue / orders / conversion), a trend chart, and a progress bar rendered right beside it |
| Want to see more? Type another question. | The panel already has "Refresh" / "Switch view" buttons — click, and the model updates the data |

## 🚀 Quick start

Prerequisites — all required:

1. **dsh installed** (any open-source build works — the plugin picks its rendering channel at startup, see "dual-channel rendering" above)
2. **`pnpm` on your PATH**: the `dsh plugin` command depends on it. If missing: `corepack enable` (or `npm i -g pnpm`), then **open a new terminal** and confirm `pnpm -v` prints a version

Install (one command, all dependencies included):

```sh
# Public GitHub install (works without an npm account)
dsh plugin --profile web add git+https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui.git
```

> ⚠️ **Don't use `link:` on a freshly cloned directory** — `link:` does not install the plugin's dependencies (mermaid / three / react), so the renderer will break. Use the git URL form above; reserve `link:` for local development iteration (see below).

Restart dsh web + hard refresh, then in a new session say "use dsh-ui to draw a stats dashboard" to verify.

### One-click script (recommended)

After cloning, just run it — the script checks the prerequisites above, performs the install, and prompts you to restart:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/omdsh-dev/dsh-genui.git
cd dsh-genui
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Developer iteration (link mode)

```sh
cd dsh-genui
pnpm install
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$PWD
```

## 🧩 What it can do

- **Answer-as-UI**: components are embedded in the reply and appear as they stream — no waiting for the whole message
- **30+ components**: cards, tables, charts, forms, tabs, accordions, file trees, timelines, diffs…
- **Function plots**: `plot` draws curves; parameter sliders redraw in real time, with optional auto-animation

</p>

- **Quiz**: `quiz` grades on click with explanation and retry; with `action`, the answer is also sent back to the model (grading stays local and instant)
- **Local grading (submit)**: a multiple-choice set = one `radio` per question with `group` + `answer` (correct answer) + `explanation`, plus one `submit` button — after the user answers everything and clicks once, **the score, per-question right/wrong, and explanations appear right in the UI with zero model round-trips**; the quiz then locks, and "retake" resets locally (optional `resetAction` notifies the model). Questions without an answer fall back to an aggregated action (`fields` collects every input with an `id`)
- **State persistence**: answers, submission locks, and input values are saved per "session + content fingerprint" — refresh or reopen restores everything; re-rendering identical content keeps user state; new content starts fresh; LRU cap of 200 blocks
- **Form semantics**: `input` Enter / `textarea` Ctrl+Enter submits immediately (`submit:true`), no blur needed; fields with an `id` are collected into the submit's `fields`
- **Secrets ban**: GenUI must never ask for passwords, API keys, access tokens, recovery codes, or other secrets; even if a password input appears, it stays masked, is never persisted, and never enters form collection
- **Local-first principle**: state changes the UI can do itself (grading, quiz checking, resets, expand/collapse, selection) always happen locally and instantly; actions are reserved for things that genuinely need the model (generating new content, running tools, next-step suggestions)
- **Honest interactions**: interactive components must carry `action`; buttons without one render disabled (kills the "looks clickable, does nothing" fake button); buttons with `action` show instant "triggered" local feedback (proof the local event fired, not that the model received it)
- **Event loop**: buttons/switches/inputs/dropdowns/checkboxes/radios/textareas/quizzes carry `action`; click or blur sends back to the model, which updates the UI; same-name actions are debounced with a 300 ms trailing edge — rapid clicks merge into one (last value wins)
- **Tool channel**: the `render_ui` tool renders the same spec as a card in the tool row (deliverable-style UI goes through the tool, answer-style UI through the fence)
- **Session panel**: a persistent dock above the composer; `render_ui` / `panel: true` fences update the same surface in place; `/panel` opens it from the client (`/panel <instruction>` customizes via the model, `/panel clear` clears); the top border is draggable to resize; `append: true` merges incrementally — same-named tabs append content, new tabs get added; the whole panel caps at 200 nodes / 200 appends, after which the model should send `replace` to rebuild
- **Self-healing & limits**: every fence passes a spec guard — bad nodes are silently dropped, numbers clamped, strings truncated; the whole tree is capped at 200 nodes / 8 nesting levels; pathological specs never crash the UI
- **Chart error self-healing**: mermaid failures auto-retry with repairs (strip backticks, quote Chinese/space labels, remove `<br/>`) before degrading to source; a broken chart never hits the screen
- **Accessibility**: tabs/accordions/switches/progress bars carry full ARIA and keyboard navigation (arrow keys switch tabs, Home/End jump)
- **Zero intrusion**: without the plugin, fences are just code blocks — no errors, no session pollution

Component JSON syntax: [SKILL.md](./SKILL.md) (also copyable to `~/.dsh/skills/genui/` to boost the model).

## 📄 Example

The model outputs this fence (written for the browser — you don't need to read it):

```dsh-ui
{"title":"Order overview","items":[
  {"type":"stat","label":"Total revenue","value":"¥128,430","delta":"+12.4%"},
  {"type":"stat","label":"Orders","value":"1,024","delta":"-3.1%"}
]}
```

What you see: two stat cards.

## 🔧 How it works

The model writes the interface description as JSON inside a `dsh-ui` fence; the browser-side renderer (`src/client`) claims this language through the main repo's `fence-registry` interface and renders it. Components are whitelisted — the model can't smuggle in HTML/scripts; function expressions go through a standalone parser, never `eval`.

The core render package stays light (≈110 KB min / 28 KB gzip); the mermaid and three.js engines are bundled separately as on-demand assets (loaded through the plugin's self-registered HTTP routes the first time they're used), so startup only downloads the rendering core.

## ❓ FAQ

- **Rendering as a code block?** Check three things: your dsh build has fence-registry (see "dual-channel rendering" at the top — builds without the extension point fall back to the DOM channel), `dsh plugin --profile web list` shows this plugin, restart + hard refresh.
- **Chat UI goes blank when rendering a dsh-ui fence?** Your dsh is too old — update dsh first, then reinstall the plugin.
- **`dsh: pnpm not found on PATH`?** Install pnpm, then **open a new terminal** and retry (`corepack enable` or `npm i -g pnpm`).
- **Stuck on git credentials / 404 during install?** The repo is public (`omdsh-dev/dsh-genui`) — the git URL above needs no login; a 404 for `@omdsh-dev/dsh-genui` means the npm package has not been published yet.
- **Installed but scene3d/mermaid don't render?** The engines (mermaid / three) are no longer inlined in client.js — they load on demand the first time they're used (`/plugins/@omdsh-dev/dsh-genui/assets/*.js`, hosted by the plugin's own HTTP routes). First restart dsh web + hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R); still broken, remove and reinstall (`dsh plugin --profile web remove @omdsh-dev/dsh-genui`, then add again). Hosts without the asset routes degrade to source/load-error hints — update dsh.
- **Model not outputting fences?** New sessions pick it up after a restart; or just say "output it with dsh-ui".
- **No lib/ after cloning?** Build it yourself: `pnpm install && pnpm run check`.

## 🧑‍💻 Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check   # type check + full tests + build
```

### Real-device e2e

The real chain end to end: start a temporary dsh web → install the plugin → send a message in a browser so the model outputs a `dsh-ui` fence → assert the rendering → click an action button → assert the model responds (event-loop closure):

```sh
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/e2e.mjs          # link-installs the current workspace
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-... node scripts/e2e.mjs --install git   # friend path (git URL)
```

Prereqs: `dsh`/`pnpm` on PATH, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, and the main repo's web build output (playwright resolves it from the main repo). On PASS it saves an `e2e-final.png` screenshot.

## 🗺️ Roadmap (evaluated)

| Direction | Verdict | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Incremental patching (model sends diffs, not full specs) | Not doing | A fence costs 200–800 tokens; resending is nearly free; a patch protocol's teaching cost and error rate aren't worth it. Revisit if sub-second auto-refreshing panels ever appear |
| Action debounce/dedup | ✅ Done (300 ms trailing edge, per action name) | Rapid-click spam is real friction; one choke point |
| Cross-session state persistence (replay restores tabs/switches) | Not doing | Replay-reset is the more correct default (the model has already updated the UI with a new fence); state survives naturally during streaming |
| MCP adapter / standalone gallery page / i18n | Not doing | No cross-tool demand signal; gallery material is covered by `gallery.ts` + demo-prompts + README screenshots; only 6 built-in strings |

Tests parse the dsh source (`vitest.config.ts`'s `DSH_ROOT`, default `~/.dsh/source/current`).
